1.) Running /toggle_off doesn't return "already off" when bot runs for the first time and the succession(?)


FIXED!


2.) A custom auto command which changes maps from a list of maps minus 6 maps that were played recently
and puts random map from a pool of available_maps.
3.) Sub ideas for the above command:
    1.) Command is only going to be active during 1pm to 1am since only then the QQ is off.
    2.) Check the number of players in EU, if they are higher than 6000 I can increase set of available_maps to include DLC.

4.) have an /info command to tell the user what is happening, what will be the next map/if custom map is on.
